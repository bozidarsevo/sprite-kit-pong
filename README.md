this is my example/version of legendary game Pong but made with Sprite Kit :)

## Gameplay

Just drag your fingers on screen to move the paddles to bounce the ball. :)

## Customize

You can easily change parameters like
* customize ball direction when ball has contact with the paddle
* ball size
* paddle size
* ball velocity
* font sizes
* speed-up multiplier
* etc.

## Video

The easiest way to show you how the game looks is to show you a video of it in action :)
But you can also run the app in Xcode and see it yourself
